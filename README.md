# Golang Microservice OAuth Scaffold (scaffold)

This little project is my starting point for OAuth based microservice projects I am working on. 

It has some basic user conset App and managing tools.

Use this to get a Quickstart on microservices with golang.

## Main libraries
* Ory/hydra - OAuth Implementation
* SPF13/Cobra - Commandline Flags and subcommands
* Labstack/echo - Simple Out of the way Webframework
